1.1.1
> Added window_info.dll! If you let her, she can comment on what ypu have open!
	> This will not work on mac or linux so.... rip you guys i guess
	> also she doesn't actually comment on much of anything yet. dont worry about it
> You can now play the word games no matter what your language is set to! Word search not included
	> also, sometimes she'll return a 1 for some reason. You can ignore this and open up the game menu again, it should be fine after that :V

	> maybe updating yaya fixed the numbers assigning weird who knows
> she can now pick up obsidian from Zicheq's ghost Dusty and Obsidian! Cuteness++!
> fixed un-minimizing making buterbrod vanish for a bit
> she can now filter lessons based on language! You'll probably have to re-download any previous lessons but seeing as im not that many people really *have* her this shouldn't be anything ghost-breaking
	> if you're a lesson creator you can check out the updated documentation for what you need to add
	> or just create a new lesson and grab the needed parameter from that idk im not your boss
> added a link to the discord server "Learn Belarusian"!
> added a link to the discord server "Ukagaka JP Pioneers"! despite the name there *are* other languages involved, like spanish and german and stuff

> Added three new games! you can play them! they're only in belarusian for now though
> Tadora will make you translate more sentences overall
> Fixed a bug where she would shuffle the letters of a single word, therefore making it impossible to get past translation tasks without using the keyboard
> Fixed a bug where the word bubbles constantly re-shuffled themselves when clicking
> Added a dictionary! You can even search words!!! you cant delete any though
> Adjusted the spacing of the main menu slightly
> Fixed buterbrod not showing up right away when switching the ghost
> Changed the highlighting in her lessons to use the anchor color of the current balloon! Hopefully this makes things more readable
> Made some changes to the font size in lessons! for clickability, I hope
	> also for readability with certain non-latin scripts
> removed a stray space in the matching game
> changed the craftmanurl to uh. me
> if you have the balloon 'Galaxy (Tarantula Nebula)' from Zichqec, she'll display it at the top of the balloon menu, just for you!
