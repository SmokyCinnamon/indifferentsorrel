Hi!!!! Thank you for downloading Tadora!!! She can help you with belarusian!!!!!!!!!!!!! (and/or whatever other languages you might be studying, provided you have a properly formatted .txt file to drag and drop onto her.)
she has a cat, too so that's cool

Original source of the alphabet skill is @AlikLagodny on duolingo, formatted with help from likikaori on discord

Also hey, do you already know belarusian? Interested in helping with the lessons on here? If so, shoot me a message over on tumblr @ev-n-learning - I could use the help!!
