			</div>
			<ul class="tree-view">
			<p>Initial setup is a thing. Let's just say we're working on that.</p>
			<p>You are building a tower, which, similar to say, onions and ogres, has layers. To start, we suggest playing a small, <strong>three-layer game.</strong> To build each layer, you must partake in a series of rounds. (The number of layers left to complete + one bonus round to..... <i>round</i> things out.)<br> Each round, every player gets one turn. Play begins going clockwise from the starting player.</p>
			<p><b>Your Turn</b></p>
			<p>Each turn consists of three actions: Assign, Work, and Build.<br><br><b>Assign:</b> Draw a card from the assignment deck.<br> You may have three active assignments at a time. <br><b>Note!</b> <i>skip</i> this step if you have <i>three active assignments</i>.<br><br><b>Work:</b> It's technically not working because it's events and tasks and.... well, a work in progress.<br>Draw a card from the work deck and follow what it says.<br>Once you have completed the task, roll a d6 and draw that many resource cards.<br><b>Note!</b> If your work has been <i>stopped</i> you <b>must skip</b> the Build phase.<br><br><b>Build:</b> You may take your gathered resources and complete one of your active assignments, then discard your used resources. (Keep your assignment on hand! We reccomend flipping it over.)<br>Lower resource requirements mean they're easier to build, but <b>beware</b>, you will gain <b>less</b> stability points.</p>
			<p>Once you're done with that, play passes to the next person.</p>
			<p><b>End of a Round</b></p>
			<p>A round ends once all players have had <b>one</b> turn.</p>
			<p>At the <b>end</b> of a round, players may trade with each other.<br><br>At the end of the final round, you do not trade, but instead add up your <b>stability points</b> to see if you passed.<br><b>For a Three-Layer game:</b> Layer one consists of four rounds, layer two of three rounds, and the final layer has two.<br>Points are decided based on the number of players, like so:<br><b>3xPlayers = Points for <i>one round</i>. Max PointsxRounds/2 = Stability points needed to pass.</b><br>For a two-player game on layer one this would end up being 6, 24 and 12 respectively. For the next two layers, add your point total to that previous number (in this case 12) and see if you still pass. For example, on layer two of a three-round, two player game, your total points needed to pass would be <b>9</b>. Total points needed would end up being 21, and on layer three that would be 6 and 27 respectively. There was some point to all this math but I can't remember what.</p>
			<p><b>Note!</b>On the final round of each layer, <b>trading is moved between Assign and Work.</b> This means turn order goes <b>Assign, Trade, Work, Build.</b></p>
